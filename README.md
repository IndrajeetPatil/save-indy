# Save Indiana Jones using JavaScript

<img src="./assets/home_background.jpeg" align="right" width="240" />

A fun game built using JavaScript to check your knowledge of JavaScript itself! 🔄

## Rules

<img src="./assets/js-logo.png" align="left" width="180" />

Three different levels correspond to proficiency levels
(*beginner*, *intermediate*, and *advanced*). That said, there are
far more questions available for the beginner level. There
are plans to add more questions for the other levels as well.

- You will win the game when the threat level drops to 0.
- You will lose the game if Indy's health drops to 0.

## References

Most of the questions are inspired by the following material:

- Flanagan, D. (2020). *JavaScript: The Definitive Guide* (7th Edition). O'Reilly.
- Padolsey, J. (2020). *Clean Code in JavaScript*. Packt Publishing.
- Brian Leroux's [WAT talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=et8xNAc2ic8&t=1s)

Needless to say, any inaccuracies reflect my poor judgment, and I would appreciate
[feedback](https://github.com/IndrajeetPatil/save-indy/issues) with
corrections/suggestions.

## Acknowledgments

The game was my submission for the third-week project for the IronHack boot camp
on web development (full-time, Berlin, Jan-March 2023). I would love to thank
my instructors for their help, and my batchmates for their company and support!
