# Save Indiana Jones using JavaScript

A fun game built using JavaScript to check your knowledge of JavaScript itself! ðŸ”„

## Rules

Three different levels correspond to proficiency levels
(*beginner*, *intermediate*, and *advanced*). That said, there are
far more questions available for the beginner level. There
are plans to add more questions for the other levels as well.

- You will win the game when the threat level drops to 0.
- You will lose the game if Indy's health drops to 0.

## References

Most of the questions are inspired by the following material:

- Flanagan, D. (2020). *JavaScript: The Definitive Guide* (7th Edition). O'Reilly.

Needless to say, any inaccuracies reflect my poor judgment, and I would appreciate

corrections/suggestions.

## Acknowledgments

The game was my submission for the third-week project for the IronHack boot camp
on web development (full-time, Berlin, Jan-March 2023). I would love to thank
my instructors for their help, and my batchmates for their company and support!
